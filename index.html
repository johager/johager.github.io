    <h1>James Hager</h1>
    <p class="tight_h1">iOS & macOS App Developer</p>

    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>I have been programming since the 1980s. I taught myself BASIC in middle school and learned Fortran in college. I worked with Fortran and UNIX extensively in graduate school where I earned a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering with a concentration in computational fluid dynamics. I worked at McDonnell Douglas, and then Boeing, in research and development, where my proudest contribution was solving a stability problem with the DARPA Affordable Rapid Response Missile Demonstrator vehicle that later flew successfully as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51_Waverider">Boeing X-51A</a>.</p>
    <p>After leaving the corporate world, I started a nature photography business. I photographed landscapes and wildlife, mainly in the US and Africa, and also led photo safaris to Africa.</p>
    <p>In 2006, I learned PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to develop database-driven websites.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, I've been using Swift to develop iOS and macOS apps driven by CoreData.</p>
    <p>I have been living full-time in my RV since 2008, and spend the majority of my time off the grid thanks to the solar-electric system I designed and installed.</p>

    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>

    <h3>AWeather (iOS App)</h3>
    <p class="tight_h3"><a href="https://avantiapplications.com/aweather/">website</a></p>
    <p>AWeather, short for Avanti Weather, is a weather app for iDevices (iPhones, iPads, and iPods) that lets you manage weather forecasts from NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the National Weather Service (NWS) while you're on the go and away from the internet. Weather data can be downloaded for multiple locations when you have a net connection and can be viewed later whether you have a net connection or not. In addition to using the accurate NOAA/NWS forecast data, you can get the forecast for where you want it and not only for major metropolitan locations.</p>
    <p>It was built using Swift, UIKit, CoreData, CoreLocation, and MapKit. It obtains data from the NWS API (JSON), websites (HTML, XML), and image repositories (JPEG, TIFF).</p>

    <h3>James Hager Photography (Website)</h3>
    <p class="tight_h3"><a href="https://jameshagerphoto.com/">website</a></p>
    <p>I created this website to feature my nature-photography work.</p>
    <p>It was built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. The blog system was set up so that I could create new blog entries on my laptop while away from the internet, export the necessary data to an XML file, and import that data into the live site when I had a net connection.</p>
    <p>I created the custom slideshow on the home page from scratch using JavaScript.</p>
